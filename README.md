# blackjack

My blackjack game currently allows two players to complete a game together. One current limitation is that both players can see what cards the other has. I have it set like this so I can make sure it's working correctly while I'm still actively editing it. Another limitation is the game will not end until someone busts or reaches 21. So, if both players choose not to hit forever, then the game will loop forever. I need to work on the scoring and hit methods to include a new scoring check that is triggered when all players choose not to hit.
